    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Crypto Trading Dashboard ("the App") is a cryptocurrency market data visualization tool. Your privacy is important to us.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The App does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All data processing happens locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Network Usage</h2>
    <p>The App connects to CoinGecko's public API to fetch live cryptocurrency market data (BTC prices). Premium users may also connect to a custom server for enhanced indicators. No personal information is sent in these requests.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App uses the following third-party services:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> - For displaying advertisements to free-tier users. AdMob may collect device identifiers and usage data for ad personalization. Premium subscribers do not see ads. See Google's <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>RevenueCat</strong> - For managing in-app subscriptions. RevenueCat processes purchase data through Google Play Billing. See their <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
