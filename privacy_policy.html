    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 10, 2026</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Crypto Trading Dashboard ("the App") is a cryptocurrency market data visualization tool. Your privacy is important to us.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The App does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data. All data processing happens locally on your device.</p>

    <h2>Network Usage</h2>
    <p>The App connects to a user-configured server to fetch cryptocurrency market indicators (price, RSI, MACD, Williams %R). No personal information is sent in these requests. If no server is configured, the App displays demo data.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App does not store any data persistently. All displayed data is fetched in real-time and discarded when the App is closed.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: buzer88@proton.me</p>
